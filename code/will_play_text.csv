"4";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.1";"KING HENRY IV";"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
"5";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.2";"KING HENRY IV";"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
"6";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.3";"KING HENRY IV";"And breathe short-winded accents of new broils"
"7";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.4";"KING HENRY IV";"To be commenced in strands afar remote."
"8";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.5";"KING HENRY IV";"No more the thirsty entrance of this soil"
"9";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.6";"KING HENRY IV";"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;"
"10";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.7";"KING HENRY IV";"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
"11";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.8";"KING HENRY IV";"Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs"
"12";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.9";"KING HENRY IV";"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
"13";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.10";"KING HENRY IV";"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
"14";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.11";"KING HENRY IV";"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
"15";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.12";"KING HENRY IV";"Did lately meet in the intestine shock"
"16";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.13";"KING HENRY IV";"And furious close of civil butchery"
"17";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.14";"KING HENRY IV";"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
"18";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.15";"KING HENRY IV";"March all one way and be no more opposed"
"19";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.16";"KING HENRY IV";"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
"20";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.17";"KING HENRY IV";"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
"21";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.18";"KING HENRY IV";"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
"22";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.19";"KING HENRY IV";"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
"23";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.20";"KING HENRY IV";"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
"24";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.21";"KING HENRY IV";"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
"25";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.22";"KING HENRY IV";"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;"
"26";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.23";"KING HENRY IV";"Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb"
"27";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.24";"KING HENRY IV";"To chase these pagans in those holy fields"
"28";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.25";"KING HENRY IV";"Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet"
"29";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.26";"KING HENRY IV";"Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd"
"30";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.27";"KING HENRY IV";"For our advantage on the bitter cross."
"31";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.28";"KING HENRY IV";"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
"32";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.29";"KING HENRY IV";"And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:"
"33";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.30";"KING HENRY IV";"Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear"
"34";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.31";"KING HENRY IV";"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
"35";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.32";"KING HENRY IV";"What yesternight our council did decree"
"36";"Henry IV";"1";"1.1.33";"KING HENRY IV";"In forwarding this dear expedience."
"37";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.34";"WESTMORELAND";"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
"38";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.35";"WESTMORELAND";"And many limits of the charge set down"
"39";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.36";"WESTMORELAND";"But yesternight: when all athwart there came"
"40";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.37";"WESTMORELAND";"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;"
"41";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.38";"WESTMORELAND";"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
"42";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.39";"WESTMORELAND";"Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight"
"43";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.40";"WESTMORELAND";"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
"44";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.41";"WESTMORELAND";"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
"45";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.42";"WESTMORELAND";"A thousand of his people butchered;"
"46";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.43";"WESTMORELAND";"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
"47";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.44";"WESTMORELAND";"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
"48";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.45";"WESTMORELAND";"By those Welshwomen done as may not be"
"49";"Henry IV";"2";"1.1.46";"WESTMORELAND";"Without much shame retold or spoken of."
"50";"Henry IV";"3";"1.1.47";"KING HENRY IV";"It seems then that the tidings of this broil"
"51";"Henry IV";"3";"1.1.48";"KING HENRY IV";"Brake off our business for the Holy Land."
"52";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.49";"WESTMORELAND";"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;"
"53";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.50";"WESTMORELAND";"For more uneven and unwelcome news"
"54";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.51";"WESTMORELAND";"Came from the north and thus it did import:"
"55";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.52";"WESTMORELAND";"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
"56";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.53";"WESTMORELAND";"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
"57";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.54";"WESTMORELAND";"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
"58";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.55";"WESTMORELAND";"At Holmedon met,"
"59";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.56";"WESTMORELAND";"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
"60";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.57";"WESTMORELAND";"As by discharge of their artillery,"
"61";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.58";"WESTMORELAND";"And shape of likelihood, the news was told;"
"62";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.59";"WESTMORELAND";"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
"63";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.60";"WESTMORELAND";"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
"64";"Henry IV";"4";"1.1.61";"WESTMORELAND";"Uncertain of the issue any way."
"65";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.62";"KING HENRY IV";"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
"66";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.63";"KING HENRY IV";"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
"67";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.64";"KING HENRY IV";"Stain'd with the variation of each soil"
"68";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.65";"KING HENRY IV";"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;"
"69";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.66";"KING HENRY IV";"And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news."
"70";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.67";"KING HENRY IV";"The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:"
"71";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.68";"KING HENRY IV";"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
"72";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.69";"KING HENRY IV";"Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see"
"73";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.70";"KING HENRY IV";"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
"74";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.71";"KING HENRY IV";"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
"75";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.72";"KING HENRY IV";"To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,"
"76";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.73";"KING HENRY IV";"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
"77";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.74";"KING HENRY IV";"And is not this an honourable spoil?"
"78";"Henry IV";"5";"1.1.75";"KING HENRY IV";"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
"79";"Henry IV";"6";"1.1.76";"WESTMORELAND";"In faith,"
"80";"Henry IV";"6";"1.1.77";"WESTMORELAND";"It is a conquest for a prince to boast of."
"81";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.78";"KING HENRY IV";"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
"82";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.79";"KING HENRY IV";"In envy that my Lord Northumberland"
"83";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.80";"KING HENRY IV";"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
"84";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.81";"KING HENRY IV";"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;"
"85";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.82";"KING HENRY IV";"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;"
"86";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.83";"KING HENRY IV";"Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:"
"87";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.84";"KING HENRY IV";"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
"88";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.85";"KING HENRY IV";"See riot and dishonour stain the brow"
"89";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.86";"KING HENRY IV";"Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved"
"90";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.87";"KING HENRY IV";"That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged"
"91";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.88";"KING HENRY IV";"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
"92";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.89";"KING HENRY IV";"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
"93";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.90";"KING HENRY IV";"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
"94";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.91";"KING HENRY IV";"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
"95";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.92";"KING HENRY IV";"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
"96";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.93";"KING HENRY IV";"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
"97";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.94";"KING HENRY IV";"To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,"
"98";"Henry IV";"7";"1.1.95";"KING HENRY IV";"I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife."
"99";"Henry IV";"8";"1.1.96";"WESTMORELAND";"This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,"
"100";"Henry IV";"8";"1.1.97";"WESTMORELAND";"Malevolent to you in all aspects;"
"101";"Henry IV";"8";"1.1.98";"WESTMORELAND";"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
"102";"Henry IV";"8";"1.1.99";"WESTMORELAND";"The crest of youth against your dignity."
"103";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.100";"KING HENRY IV";"But I have sent for him to answer this;"
"104";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.101";"KING HENRY IV";"And for this cause awhile we must neglect"
"105";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.102";"KING HENRY IV";"Our holy purpose to Jerusalem."
"106";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.103";"KING HENRY IV";"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
"107";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.104";"KING HENRY IV";"Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:"
"108";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.105";"KING HENRY IV";"But come yourself with speed to us again;"
"109";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.106";"KING HENRY IV";"For more is to be said and to be done"
"110";"Henry IV";"9";"1.1.107";"KING HENRY IV";"Than out of anger can be uttered."
"111";"Henry IV";"10";"1.1.108";"WESTMORELAND";"I will, my liege."
"112";"Henry IV";"10";;"WESTMORELAND";"Exeunt"
"113";"Henry IV";"10";;"WESTMORELAND";"SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's."
"114";"Henry IV";"10";;"WESTMORELAND";"Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF"
"115";"Henry IV";"1";"1.2.1";"FALSTAFF";"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
"116";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.2";"PRINCE HENRY";"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
"117";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.3";"PRINCE HENRY";"and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon"
"118";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.4";"PRINCE HENRY";"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
"119";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.5";"PRINCE HENRY";"demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know."
"120";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.6";"PRINCE HENRY";"What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the"
"121";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.7";"PRINCE HENRY";"day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes"
"122";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.8";"PRINCE HENRY";"capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the"
"123";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.9";"PRINCE HENRY";"signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself"
"124";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.10";"PRINCE HENRY";"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
"125";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.11";"PRINCE HENRY";"reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand"
"126";"Henry IV";"2";"1.2.12";"PRINCE HENRY";"the time of the day."
"127";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.13";"FALSTAFF";"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take"
"128";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.14";"FALSTAFF";"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
"129";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.15";"FALSTAFF";"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
"130";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.16";"FALSTAFF";"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
"131";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.17";"FALSTAFF";"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
"132";"Henry IV";"3";"1.2.18";"FALSTAFF";"thou wilt have none,--"
"133";"Henry IV";"4";"1.2.19";"PRINCE HENRY";"What, none?"
"134";"Henry IV";"5";"1.2.20";"FALSTAFF";"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
"135";"Henry IV";"5";"1.2.21";"FALSTAFF";"prologue to an egg and butter."
"136";"Henry IV";"6";"1.2.22";"PRINCE HENRY";"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
"137";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.23";"FALSTAFF";"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
"138";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.24";"FALSTAFF";"us that are squires of the night's body be called"
"139";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.25";"FALSTAFF";"thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's"
"140";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.26";"FALSTAFF";"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
"141";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.27";"FALSTAFF";"moon; and let men say we be men of good government,"
"142";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.28";"FALSTAFF";"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
"143";"Henry IV";"7";"1.2.29";"FALSTAFF";"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
"144";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.30";"PRINCE HENRY";"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the"
"145";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.31";"PRINCE HENRY";"fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and"
"146";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.32";"PRINCE HENRY";"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
"147";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.33";"PRINCE HENRY";"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
"148";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.34";"PRINCE HENRY";"most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most"
"149";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.35";"PRINCE HENRY";"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with"
"150";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.36";"PRINCE HENRY";"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'"
"151";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.37";"PRINCE HENRY";"now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder"
"152";"Henry IV";"8";"1.2.38";"PRINCE HENRY";"and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows."
"153";"Henry IV";"9";"1.2.39";"FALSTAFF";"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
"154";"Henry IV";"9";"1.2.40";"FALSTAFF";"hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?"
"155";"Henry IV";"10";"1.2.41";"PRINCE HENRY";"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
"156";"Henry IV";"10";"1.2.42";"PRINCE HENRY";"is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?"
"157";"Henry IV";"11";"1.2.43";"FALSTAFF";"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
"158";"Henry IV";"11";"1.2.44";"FALSTAFF";"thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a"
"159";"Henry IV";"11";"1.2.45";"FALSTAFF";"buff jerkin?"
"160";"Henry IV";"12";"1.2.46";"PRINCE HENRY";"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
"161";"Henry IV";"13";"1.2.47";"FALSTAFF";"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
"162";"Henry IV";"13";"1.2.48";"FALSTAFF";"time and oft."
"163";"Henry IV";"14";"1.2.49";"PRINCE HENRY";"Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?"
"164";"Henry IV";"15";"1.2.50";"FALSTAFF";"No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
"165";"Henry IV";"16";"1.2.51";"PRINCE HENRY";"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;"
"166";"Henry IV";"16";"1.2.52";"PRINCE HENRY";"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
"167";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.53";"FALSTAFF";"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
"168";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.54";"FALSTAFF";"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
"169";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.55";"FALSTAFF";"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
"170";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.56";"FALSTAFF";"thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is"
"171";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.57";"FALSTAFF";"with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do"
"172";"Henry IV";"17";"1.2.58";"FALSTAFF";"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
"173";"Henry IV";"18";"1.2.59";"PRINCE HENRY";"No; thou shalt."
"174";"Henry IV";"19";"1.2.60";"FALSTAFF";"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
"175";"Henry IV";"20";"1.2.61";"PRINCE HENRY";"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
"176";"Henry IV";"20";"1.2.62";"PRINCE HENRY";"the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman."
"177";"Henry IV";"21";"1.2.63";"FALSTAFF";"Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my"
"178";"Henry IV";"21";"1.2.64";"FALSTAFF";"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
"179";"Henry IV";"21";"1.2.65";"FALSTAFF";"you."
"180";"Henry IV";"22";"1.2.66";"PRINCE HENRY";"For obtaining of suits?"
"181";"Henry IV";"23";"1.2.67";"FALSTAFF";"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
"182";"Henry IV";"23";"1.2.68";"FALSTAFF";"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
"183";"Henry IV";"23";"1.2.69";"FALSTAFF";"as a gib cat or a lugged bear."
"184";"Henry IV";"24";"1.2.70";"PRINCE HENRY";"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
"185";"Henry IV";"25";"1.2.71";"FALSTAFF";"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
"186";"Henry IV";"26";"1.2.72";"PRINCE HENRY";"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
"187";"Henry IV";"26";"1.2.73";"PRINCE HENRY";"Moor-ditch?"
"188";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.74";"FALSTAFF";"Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed"
"189";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.75";"FALSTAFF";"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
"190";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.76";"FALSTAFF";"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
"191";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.77";"FALSTAFF";"with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a"
"192";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.78";"FALSTAFF";"commodity of good names were to be bought. An old"
"193";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.79";"FALSTAFF";"lord of the council rated me the other day in the"
"194";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.80";"FALSTAFF";"street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet"
"195";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.81";"FALSTAFF";"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and"
"196";"Henry IV";"27";"1.2.82";"FALSTAFF";"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
"197";"Henry IV";"28";"1.2.83";"PRINCE HENRY";"Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the"
"198";"Henry IV";"28";"1.2.84";"PRINCE HENRY";"streets, and no man regards it."
"199";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.85";"FALSTAFF";"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
"200";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.86";"FALSTAFF";"to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon"
"201";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.87";"FALSTAFF";"me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
"202";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.88";"FALSTAFF";"thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man"
"203";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.89";"FALSTAFF";"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
"204";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.90";"FALSTAFF";"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
"205";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.91";"FALSTAFF";"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
"206";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.92";"FALSTAFF";"I'll be damned for never a king's son in"
"207";"Henry IV";"29";"1.2.93";"FALSTAFF";"Christendom."
"208";"Henry IV";"30";"1.2.94";"PRINCE HENRY";"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
"209";"Henry IV";"31";"1.2.95";"FALSTAFF";"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I"
"210";"Henry IV";"31";"1.2.96";"FALSTAFF";"do not, call me villain and baffle me."

"276";"Henry IV";"55";"1.2.160";"POINS";"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
"277";"Henry IV";"55";"1.2.161";"POINS";"upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have"

"285";"Henry IV";"57";"1.2.169";"POINS";"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
"286";"Henry IV";"58";"1.2.170";"PRINCE HENRY";"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."

"1222";"Henry IV";"93";"2.4.219";"PRINCE HENRY";"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal"

"1229";"Henry IV";"95";"2.4.226";"FALSTAFF";"compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as"
"1230";"Henry IV";"95";"2.4.227";"FALSTAFF";"blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon"

"1244";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.241";"PRINCE HENRY";"We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and"

"1246";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.243";"PRINCE HENRY";"tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you"
"1247";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.244";"PRINCE HENRY";"four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your"
"1248";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.245";"PRINCE HENRY";"prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in"
"1249";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.246";"PRINCE HENRY";"the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts"
"1250";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.247";"PRINCE HENRY";"away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared"
"1251";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.248";"PRINCE HENRY";"for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard"

"1254";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.251";"PRINCE HENRY";"What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst"
"1255";"Henry IV";"100";"2.4.252";"PRINCE HENRY";"thou now find out to hide thee from this open and"

"1258";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.255";"FALSTAFF";"By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye."
"1259";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.256";"FALSTAFF";"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the"
"1260";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.257";"FALSTAFF";"heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?"
"1261";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.258";"FALSTAFF";"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but"
"1262";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.259";"FALSTAFF";"beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true"
"1263";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.260";"FALSTAFF";"prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a"
"1264";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.261";"FALSTAFF";"coward on instinct. I shall think the better of"
"1265";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.262";"FALSTAFF";"myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant"
"1266";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.263";"FALSTAFF";"lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,"
"1267";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.264";"FALSTAFF";"lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap"
"1268";"Henry IV";"102";"2.4.265";"FALSTAFF";"to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow."

"1272";"Henry IV";"103";"2.4.269";"PRINCE HENRY";"Content; and the argument shall be thy running away."
"1273";"Henry IV";"104";"2.4.270";"FALSTAFF";"Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!"
"1274";"Henry IV";"104";;"FALSTAFF";"Enter Hostess"

"1276";"Henry IV";"106";"2.4.272";"PRINCE HENRY";"How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to"
"1277";"Henry IV";"106";"2.4.273";"PRINCE HENRY";"me?"
"1278";"Henry IV";"107";"2.4.274";"Hostess";"Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at"
"1279";"Henry IV";"107";"2.4.275";"Hostess";"door would speak with you: he says he comes from"
"1280";"Henry IV";"107";"2.4.276";"Hostess";"your father."
"1281";"Henry IV";"108";"2.4.277";"PRINCE HENRY";"Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and"
"1282";"Henry IV";"108";"2.4.278";"PRINCE HENRY";"send him back again to my mother."
"1283";"Henry IV";"109";"2.4.279";"FALSTAFF";"What manner of man is he?"
"1284";"Henry IV";"110";"2.4.280";"Hostess";"An old man."
"1285";"Henry IV";"111";"2.4.281";"FALSTAFF";"What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall"
"1286";"Henry IV";"111";"2.4.282";"FALSTAFF";"I give him his answer?"
"1287";"Henry IV";"112";"2.4.283";"PRINCE HENRY";"Prithee, do, Jack."
"1288";"Henry IV";"113";"2.4.284";"FALSTAFF";"'Faith, and I'll send him packing."
"1289";"Henry IV";"113";;"FALSTAFF";"Exit FALSTAFF"
"1290";"Henry IV";"114";"2.4.285";"PRINCE HENRY";"Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,"
"1291";"Henry IV";"114";"2.4.286";"PRINCE HENRY";"Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you"
"1292";"Henry IV";"114";"2.4.287";"PRINCE HENRY";"ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true"
"1293";"Henry IV";"114";"2.4.288";"PRINCE HENRY";"prince; no, fie!"
"1294";"Henry IV";"115";"2.4.289";"BARDOLPH";"'Faith, I ran when I saw others run."
"1295";"Henry IV";"116";"2.4.290";"PRINCE HENRY";"'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's"
"1296";"Henry IV";"116";"2.4.291";"PRINCE HENRY";"sword so hacked?"
"1297";"Henry IV";"117";"2.4.292";"PETO";"Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would"
"1298";"Henry IV";"117";"2.4.293";"PETO";"swear truth out of England but he would make you"
"1299";"Henry IV";"117";"2.4.294";"PETO";"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like."
"1300";"Henry IV";"118";"2.4.295";"BARDOLPH";"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to"
"1301";"Henry IV";"118";"2.4.296";"BARDOLPH";"make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments"
"1302";"Henry IV";"118";"2.4.297";"BARDOLPH";"with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I"
"1303";"Henry IV";"118";"2.4.298";"BARDOLPH";"did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed"
"1304";"Henry IV";"118";"2.4.299";"BARDOLPH";"to hear his monstrous devices."
"1305";"Henry IV";"119";"2.4.300";"PRINCE HENRY";"O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years"
"1306";"Henry IV";"119";"2.4.301";"PRINCE HENRY";"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since"
"1307";"Henry IV";"119";"2.4.302";"PRINCE HENRY";"thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and"
"1308";"Henry IV";"119";"2.4.303";"PRINCE HENRY";"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what"
"1309";"Henry IV";"119";"2.4.304";"PRINCE HENRY";"instinct hadst thou for it?"
"1310";"Henry IV";"120";"2.4.305";"BARDOLPH";"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold"
"1311";"Henry IV";"120";"2.4.306";"BARDOLPH";"these exhalations?"
"1312";"Henry IV";"121";"2.4.307";"PRINCE HENRY";"I do."
"1313";"Henry IV";"122";"2.4.308";"BARDOLPH";"What think you they portend?"
"1314";"Henry IV";"123";"2.4.309";"PRINCE HENRY";"Hot livers and cold purses."
"1315";"Henry IV";"124";"2.4.310";"BARDOLPH";"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken."
"1316";"Henry IV";"125";"2.4.311";"PRINCE HENRY";"No, if rightly taken, halter."
"1317";"Henry IV";"125";;"PRINCE HENRY";"Re-enter FALSTAFF"

"1319";"Henry IV";"125";"2.4.313";"PRINCE HENRY";"How now, my sweet creature of bombast!"
"1320";"Henry IV";"125";"2.4.314";"PRINCE HENRY";"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?"
"1321";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.315";"FALSTAFF";"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was"
"1322";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.316";"FALSTAFF";"not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have"
"1323";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.317";"FALSTAFF";"crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of"
"1324";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.318";"FALSTAFF";"sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a"
"1325";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.319";"FALSTAFF";"bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was"
"1326";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.320";"FALSTAFF";"Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the"
"1327";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.321";"FALSTAFF";"court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the"
"1328";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.322";"FALSTAFF";"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the"
"1329";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.323";"FALSTAFF";"bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the"
"1330";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.324";"FALSTAFF";"devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh"
"1331";"Henry IV";"126";"2.4.325";"FALSTAFF";"hook--what a plague call you him?"
"1332";"Henry IV";"127";"2.4.326";"POINS";"O, Glendower."
"1333";"Henry IV";"128";"2.4.327";"FALSTAFF";"Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,"
"1334";"Henry IV";"128";"2.4.328";"FALSTAFF";"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of"
"1335";"Henry IV";"128";"2.4.329";"FALSTAFF";"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill"
"1336";"Henry IV";"128";"2.4.330";"FALSTAFF";"perpendicular,--"
"1337";"Henry IV";"129";"2.4.331";"PRINCE HENRY";"He that rides at high speed and with his pistol"
"1338";"Henry IV";"129";"2.4.332";"PRINCE HENRY";"kills a sparrow flying."
"1339";"Henry IV";"130";"2.4.333";"FALSTAFF";"You have hit it."
"1340";"Henry IV";"131";"2.4.334";"PRINCE HENRY";"So did he never the sparrow."
"1341";"Henry IV";"132";"2.4.335";"FALSTAFF";"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run."
"1342";"Henry IV";"133";"2.4.336";"PRINCE HENRY";"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so"
"1343";"Henry IV";"133";"2.4.337";"PRINCE HENRY";"for running!"
"1344";"Henry IV";"134";"2.4.338";"FALSTAFF";"O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot."
"1345";"Henry IV";"135";"2.4.339";"PRINCE HENRY";"Yes, Jack, upon instinct."
"1346";"Henry IV";"136";"2.4.340";"FALSTAFF";"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,"
"1347";"Henry IV";"136";"2.4.341";"FALSTAFF";"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:"
"1348";"Henry IV";"136";"2.4.342";"FALSTAFF";"Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's"
"1349";"Henry IV";"136";"2.4.343";"FALSTAFF";"beard is turned white with the news: you may buy"
"1350";"Henry IV";"136";"2.4.344";"FALSTAFF";"land now as cheap as stinking mackerel."
"1351";"Henry IV";"137";"2.4.345";"PRINCE HENRY";"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and"
"1352";"Henry IV";"137";"2.4.346";"PRINCE HENRY";"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads"
"1353";"Henry IV";"137";"2.4.347";"PRINCE HENRY";"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds."
"1354";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.348";"FALSTAFF";"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we"
"1355";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.349";"FALSTAFF";"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,"
"1356";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.350";"FALSTAFF";"art not thou horrible afeard? thou being"
"1357";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.351";"FALSTAFF";"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three"
"1358";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.352";"FALSTAFF";"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that"
"1359";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.353";"FALSTAFF";"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou"
"1360";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.354";"FALSTAFF";"not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at"
"1361";"Henry IV";"138";"2.4.355";"FALSTAFF";"it?"
"1362";"Henry IV";"139";"2.4.356";"PRINCE HENRY";"Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct."
"1363";"Henry IV";"140";"2.4.357";"FALSTAFF";"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou"
"1364";"Henry IV";"140";"2.4.358";"FALSTAFF";"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer."
"1365";"Henry IV";"141";"2.4.359";"PRINCE HENRY";"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the"
"1366";"Henry IV";"141";"2.4.360";"PRINCE HENRY";"particulars of my life."
"1367";"Henry IV";"142";"2.4.361";"FALSTAFF";"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,"
"1368";"Henry IV";"142";"2.4.362";"FALSTAFF";"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown."
"1369";"Henry IV";"143";"2.4.363";"PRINCE HENRY";"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden"

"1372";"Henry IV";"144";"2.4.366";"FALSTAFF";"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,"
"1373";"Henry IV";"144";"2.4.367";"FALSTAFF";"now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to"
"1374";"Henry IV";"144";"2.4.368";"FALSTAFF";"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have"
"1375";"Henry IV";"144";"2.4.369";"FALSTAFF";"wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it"
"1376";"Henry IV";"144";"2.4.370";"FALSTAFF";"in King Cambyses' vein."
"1377";"Henry IV";"145";"2.4.371";"PRINCE HENRY";"Well, here is my leg."
"1378";"Henry IV";"146";"2.4.372";"FALSTAFF";"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility."
"1379";"Henry IV";"147";"2.4.373";"Hostess";"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!"
"1380";"Henry IV";"148";"2.4.374";"FALSTAFF";"Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain."
"1381";"Henry IV";"149";"2.4.375";"Hostess";"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!"
"1382";"Henry IV";"150";"2.4.376";"FALSTAFF";"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;"
"1383";"Henry IV";"150";"2.4.377";"FALSTAFF";"For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes."
"1384";"Henry IV";"151";"2.4.378";"Hostess";"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry"
"1385";"Henry IV";"151";"2.4.379";"Hostess";"players as ever I see!"
"1386";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.380";"FALSTAFF";"Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain."
"1387";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.381";"FALSTAFF";"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy"
"1388";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.382";"FALSTAFF";"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though"
"1389";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.383";"FALSTAFF";"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster"
"1390";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.384";"FALSTAFF";"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the"
"1391";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.385";"FALSTAFF";"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have"
"1392";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.386";"FALSTAFF";"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,"
"1393";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.387";"FALSTAFF";"but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a"
"1394";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.388";"FALSTAFF";"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant"
"1395";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.389";"FALSTAFF";"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;"
"1396";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.390";"FALSTAFF";"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall"
"1397";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.391";"FALSTAFF";"the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat"
"1398";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.392";"FALSTAFF";"blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall"
"1399";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.393";"FALSTAFF";"the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a"
"1400";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.394";"FALSTAFF";"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,"
"1401";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.395";"FALSTAFF";"which thou hast often heard of and it is known to"
"1402";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.396";"FALSTAFF";"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,"
"1403";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.397";"FALSTAFF";"as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth"
"1404";"Henry IV";"152";"2.4.398";"FALSTAFF";"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not"

"2417";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.38";"FALSTAFF";"all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye"
"2418";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.39";"FALSTAFF";"hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through"

"2422";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.43";"FALSTAFF";"prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my"
"2423";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.44";"FALSTAFF";"company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
"2424";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.45";"FALSTAFF";"together and thrown over the shoulders like an"
"2425";"Henry IV";"7";"4.2.46";"FALSTAFF";"herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say"

"5761";"Henry VI Part 1";"15";"5.3.79";"SUFFOLK";"She is a woman, therefore to be won."
"5762";"Henry VI Part 1";"16";"5.3.80";"MARGARET";"Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no."

"5768";"Henry VI Part 1";"21";"5.3.86";"SUFFOLK";"And yet a dispensation may be had."
"5769";"Henry VI Part 1";"22";"5.3.87";"MARGARET";"And yet I would that you would answer me."
"5770";"Henry VI Part 1";"23";"5.3.88";"SUFFOLK";"I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?"
"5771";"Henry VI Part 1";"23";"5.3.89";"SUFFOLK";"Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!"
"5772";"Henry VI Part 1";"24";"5.3.90";"MARGARET";"He talks of wood: it is some carpenter."
"5773";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.91";"SUFFOLK";"Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,"
"5774";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.92";"SUFFOLK";"And peace established between these realms"
"5775";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.93";"SUFFOLK";"But there remains a scruple in that too;"
"5776";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.94";"SUFFOLK";"For though her father be the King of Naples,"
"5777";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.95";"SUFFOLK";"Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,"
"5778";"Henry VI Part 1";"25";"5.3.96";"SUFFOLK";"And our nobility will scorn the match."

"5780";"Henry VI Part 1";"27";"5.3.98";"SUFFOLK";"It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much."
"5781";"Henry VI Part 1";"27";"5.3.99";"SUFFOLK";"Henry is youthful and will quickly yield."
"5782";"Henry VI Part 1";"27";"5.3.100";"SUFFOLK";"Madam, I have a secret to reveal."
"5783";"Henry VI Part 1";"28";"5.3.101";"MARGARET";"What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,"
"5784";"Henry VI Part 1";"28";"5.3.102";"MARGARET";"And will not any way dishonour me."
"5785";"Henry VI Part 1";"29";"5.3.103";"SUFFOLK";"Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say."
"5786";"Henry VI Part 1";"30";"5.3.104";"MARGARET";"Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;"
"5787";"Henry VI Part 1";"30";"5.3.105";"MARGARET";"And then I need not crave his courtesy."
"5788";"Henry VI Part 1";"31";"5.3.106";"SUFFOLK";"Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--"
"5789";"Henry VI Part 1";"32";"5.3.107";"MARGARET";"Tush, women have been captivate ere now."
"5790";"Henry VI Part 1";"33";"5.3.108";"SUFFOLK";"Lady, wherefore talk you so?"
"5791";"Henry VI Part 1";"34";"5.3.109";"MARGARET";"I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo."
"5792";"Henry VI Part 1";"35";"5.3.110";"SUFFOLK";"Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose"
"5793";"Henry VI Part 1";"35";"5.3.111";"SUFFOLK";"Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?"
"5794";"Henry VI Part 1";"36";"5.3.112";"MARGARET";"To be a queen in bondage is more vile"
"5795";"Henry VI Part 1";"36";"5.3.113";"MARGARET";"Than is a slave in base servility;"
"5796";"Henry VI Part 1";"36";"5.3.114";"MARGARET";"For princes should be free."
"5797";"Henry VI Part 1";"37";"5.3.115";"SUFFOLK";"And so shall you,"
"5798";"Henry VI Part 1";"37";"5.3.116";"SUFFOLK";"If happy England's royal king be free."
"5799";"Henry VI Part 1";"38";"5.3.117";"MARGARET";"Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?"
"5800";"Henry VI Part 1";"39";"5.3.118";"SUFFOLK";"I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,"
"5801";"Henry VI Part 1";"39";"5.3.119";"SUFFOLK";"To put a golden sceptre in thy hand"
"5802";"Henry VI Part 1";"39";"5.3.120";"SUFFOLK";"And set a precious crown upon thy head,"
"5803";"Henry VI Part 1";"39";"5.3.121";"SUFFOLK";"If thou wilt condescend to be my--"
"5804";"Henry VI Part 1";"40";"5.3.122";"MARGARET";"What?"
"5805";"Henry VI Part 1";"41";"5.3.123";"SUFFOLK";"His love."
"5806";"Henry VI Part 1";"42";"5.3.124";"MARGARET";"I am unworthy to be Henry's wife."
"5807";"Henry VI Part 1";"43";"5.3.125";"SUFFOLK";"No, gentle madam; I unworthy am"
"5808";"Henry VI Part 1";"43";"5.3.126";"SUFFOLK";"To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,"
"5809";"Henry VI Part 1";"43";"5.3.127";"SUFFOLK";"And have no portion in the choice myself."
"5810";"Henry VI Part 1";"43";"5.3.128";"SUFFOLK";"How say you, madam, are ye so content?"
"5811";"Henry VI Part 1";"44";"5.3.129";"MARGARET";"An if my father please, I am content."
"5812";"Henry VI Part 1";"45";"5.3.130";"SUFFOLK";"Then call our captains and our colours forth."
"5813";"Henry VI Part 1";"45";"5.3.131";"SUFFOLK";"And, madam, at your father's castle walls"
"5814";"Henry VI Part 1";"45";"5.3.132";"SUFFOLK";"We'll crave a parley, to confer with him."
"5815";"Henry VI Part 1";"45";;"SUFFOLK";"A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls"
"5816";"Henry VI Part 1";"45";"5.3.133";"SUFFOLK";"See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!"

"5818";"Henry VI Part 1";"47";"5.3.135";"SUFFOLK";"To me."
"5819";"Henry VI Part 1";"48";"5.3.136";"REIGNIER";"Suffolk, what remedy?"
"5820";"Henry VI Part 1";"48";"5.3.137";"REIGNIER";"I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,"
"5821";"Henry VI Part 1";"48";"5.3.138";"REIGNIER";"Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness."
"5822";"Henry VI Part 1";"49";"5.3.139";"SU FFOLK";"Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:"
"5823";"Henry VI Part 1";"49";"5.3.140";"SU FFOLK";"Consent, and for thy honour give consent,"
"5824";"Henry VI Part 1";"49";"5.3.141";"SU FFOLK";"Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;"

"5827";"Henry VI Part 1";"49";"5.3.144";"SU FFOLK";"Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty."
"5828";"Henry VI Part 1";"50";"5.3.145";"REIGNIER";"Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?"
"5829";"Henry VI Part 1";"51";"5.3.146";"SUFFOLK";"Fair Margaret knows"
"5830";"Henry VI Part 1";"51";"5.3.147";"SUFFOLK";"That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign."
"5831";"Henry VI Part 1";"52";"5.3.148";"REIGNIER";"Upon thy princely warrant, I descend"

"5839";"Henry VI Part 1";"55";"5.3.154";"SUFFOLK";"Fit to be made companion with a king:"
"5840";"Henry VI Part 1";"55";"5.3.155";"SUFFOLK";"What answer makes your grace unto my suit?"
"5841";"Henry VI Part 1";"56";"5.3.156";"REIGNIER";"Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth"
"5842";"Henry VI Part 1";"56";"5.3.157";"REIGNIER";"To be the princely bride of such a lord;"
"5843";"Henry VI Part 1";"56";"5.3.158";"REIGNIER";"Upon condition I may quietly"
"5844";"Henry VI Part 1";"56";"5.3.159";"REIGNIER";"Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,"

"5852";"Henry VI Part 1";"58";"5.3.167";"REIGNIER";"Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith."
"5853";"Henry VI Part 1";"59";"5.3.168";"SUFFOLK";"Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,"
"5854";"Henry VI Part 1";"59";"5.3.169";"SUFFOLK";"Because this is in traffic of a king."
"5855";"Henry VI Part 1";"59";;"SUFFOLK";"Aside"
"5856";"Henry VI Part 1";"59";"5.3.170";"SUFFOLK";"And yet, methinks, I could be well content"
"5857";"Henry VI Part 1";"59";"5.3.171";"SUFFOLK";"To be mine own attorney in this case."
